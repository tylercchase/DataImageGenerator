###QR Code Generator

**Functions**
 - Be able to generate some sort of image that stores data (possibly .ppm since it's been recommended)
 - Be able to take the image that was generated and output the data that is contained within
    - It might be a good idea to develop an android app for this though it may be outside the scope of the class
