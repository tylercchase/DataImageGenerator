 # Image data Generator

## Premise
 For my final project for CS201, the topics seemed like they would take hardly any time, and I currently have too much time on my hands. Due to this, I'm blending multiple topics for the final projects including: 
 - Image generation
 - Image manipulation
 - Reading a file format (Possibly if you consider reading parts of an image?)
 
## Results
The final product for a qr code wasn't finished by the end date, as it turns out QR codes can end up being a ton more complicated than I thought they would be. Despite not being able to finish still achieved a 100/100 for the project. The project is being continued on another of my repositories for my account.
