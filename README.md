 # Image data Generator

## Premise
 For my final project for CS201, the topics seemed like they would take hardly any time, and I currently have too much time on my hands. Due to this, I'm blending multiple topics for the final projects including: 
 - Image generation
 - Image manipulation
 - Reading a file format (Possibly if you consider reading parts of an image?)
 - Possibly File compression in the form of compresssing text to store inside an image(though due to time constraints this may not be possible)

## Functions
 - Be able to generate some sort of image that stores data (possibly .ppm since it's been recommended)
 - Be able to take the image that was generated and output the data that is contained within
    - It might be a good idea to develop an android app for this though it may be outside the scope of the class
## Ideas
 - Possibly look into opengl or opencv to manipulate images
 - Use the .ppm file format for images, though it appears to be old and depreceated.
  - Look into other file formats
 - Start out with basic bar code, and work my way up to a full on QR code
